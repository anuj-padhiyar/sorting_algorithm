# Selection Sort<br>
There are two part of array in this algorithm.
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
For example, the lower part of an array is maintained to be sorted.
In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.

`Time Complexity`<br>
Worst Case => O(n^2)<br>
Average Case => O(n^2)<br>
Best Case => O(n^2)<br><br>

`space complexity` => O(1)
